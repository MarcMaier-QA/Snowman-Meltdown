# Snowman Meltdown

A fun Python-based Snowman (Hangman-style) game with ASCII-art stages.

## How to Play
Guess the letters of a randomly selected word. Each wrong guess melts the snowman step by step. The game ends when you guess the word or the snowman melts completely.

## Note
Some of the ASCII-art stages may not display correctly in certain environments, such as Codio's terminal. The game logic and functionality remain fully operational.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
